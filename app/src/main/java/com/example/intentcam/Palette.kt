/**
 * Semantic color palette for IntentCam.
 *
 * Replaces ~27 hardcoded `Color(0xFFxxxxxx)` literals scattered
 * across MainActivity.kt with named slots in one place.  Each
 * slot has an "intent" (what the color *means*) so adding a new
 * screen never has to introduce a new hex code — you pick the
 * existing slot whose meaning matches.
 *
 * Slots chosen against the actual usage in MainActivity:
 *  - `background`              — full-screen black backdrop
 *  - `surface`                 — bubble card / sheet surface
 *  - `surfaceOverlay`          — semi-transparent overlay (top bar, sheet, sheet header)
 *  - `surfaceMuted`            — debug log panel bg
 *  - `onSurface`               — primary text on dark surface
 *  - `onSurfaceMuted`          — secondary text (sheet headers, table cells)
 *  - `onSurfaceSubtle`         — tertiary text (table kind column, debug row)
 *  - `accentExecute`           — pink — consent-gated chip (dial_number / scan_to_pay / redact_id)
 *  - `accentDelegate`          — blue — OS-handoff chip (open_in_maps / share)
 *  - `accentClarify`           — gray — info-only chip / unknown
 *  - `success`                 — green — location dot, debug toggle on, completed badge
 *  - `warning`                 — orange — "需要补充信息" hint
 *  - `danger`                  — red — error banner border, "已替换" sup badge is `onSurfaceMuted`
 *  - `divider`                 — table row separator
 *
 * [Dark-only build]: LightPalette is defined for completeness but
 * the device fleet is overwhelmingly dark-mode; switching
 * `isSystemInDarkTheme()` is a no-op for now.  The data class
 * stays so a future light-mode pass only needs to fill the
 * `LightPalette` instance.
